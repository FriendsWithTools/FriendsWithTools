# Codeworks code reviews

This repo is used to do code reviews for entire projects from students.

## How it works

- Fork this repo and clone the fork on your computer.
- Copy all the code from your project to that clone (including gitignore files).
- Commit all your code and push it to your fork.
- Send a pull request (feel free to add a comment to your PR, in case it's useful for the reviewer).
- Send a message on Slack to who is in charge of your code review, with a link to the pull request.
- You will receive a notification once the code review is completed.
